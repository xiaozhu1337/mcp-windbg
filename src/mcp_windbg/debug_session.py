"""Shared machinery for driving a CDB/KD debugger subprocess.

Both the user-mode debugger (``cdb.exe``, see :mod:`cdb_session`) and the kernel
debugger (``kd.exe``, see :mod:`kd_session`) talk to their process the same way:
launch it on a pipe, read its stdout on a background thread, and detect when a
command has finished by echoing a unique marker after it. That protocol lives
here once; the two session types only differ in how they are launched and how
they reach their first prompt.

Robustness properties of this shared implementation:

- **Session-unique per-command markers.** Every command echoes
  ``COMMAND_COMPLETED_MARKER_<nonce>_<n>`` with a random session nonce and a
  monotonic counter. Only the exact standalone output completes the command;
  delayed markers, another client's markers and echoed commands cannot do so.
- **Cancel-on-timeout for live targets.** When a command on a live session
  (user-mode remote or kernel) outruns its timeout, the debugger is still busy
  executing it. We send CTRL+BREAK to break back in, drain to the pending
  marker, and only then report the timeout - leaving the session resynchronized
  instead of wedged.
- **Go-class commands do not use the marker at all.** ``g`` and its relatives
  hand the CPU back to the target, and the debugger stops reading stdin until
  the target stops again. Marking them would queue an ``.echo`` the debugger
  cannot answer, so the command would "time out" and the resulting CTRL+BREAK
  would halt the target we just released. They are written bare instead, and
  ``wait_for_break`` picks up whatever the target prints when it does stop.
- **Exit is noticed, not timed out.** When the debugger process exits (``q``, a
  failed ``-remote``/``-k`` connect, cdb itself crashing), the reader sees EOF
  and wakes whoever is waiting, who reports the exit status and the debugger's
  last output instead of sitting out the timeout and blaming the command.

        Queues a marker into the debugger's stdin. While the target runs the
        debugger is not reading input, so the marker sits there; when the target
        stops - a bugcheck, a breakpoint, a manual break-in - the debugger drains
        its input and echoes it. Everything printed in between (the crash banner,
        the breakpoint report) arrives ahead of the marker and is returned.

        The marker is queued unconditionally rather than short-circuiting on our
        own "is it running" flag: the debugger answering at once *is* the proof
