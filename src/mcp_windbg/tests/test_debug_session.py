"""Hermetic tests for DebuggerSession's timeout and go/break-in handling.

The scenarios drive a real debugger and cover the marker protocol's happy path
(a command returns its own output) far better than a fake can. What they cannot
do is make a debugger stop answering, or make a target bugcheck on cue. So the
fake in-process "debugger" here covers those: it can be told to swallow markers
(exercising the cancel-on-timeout resync), and it models the one behaviour that
makes go-class commands special - while the target runs, the debugger stops
reading its stdin, so anything written to it is queued until the target stops.
